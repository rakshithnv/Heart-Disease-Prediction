Heart Disease Prediction - Decision Tree
You are the data scientist at a medical research facility. The facility wants you to build a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack.

Tasks Performed:

Data Analysis:
a. Import the dataset

b. Get information about the dataset (mean, max, min, quartiles etc.)

c. Find the correlation between all fields

Data Visualization:
a. Visualize the number of patients having a heart disease and not having a heart disease

b. Visualize the age and whether a patient has disease or not

c. Visualize correlation between all features using a heat map

Logistic Regression:
a. Build a simple logistic regression model:

i. Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio

ii. Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set

iii. Build the confusion matrix and get the accuracy score

Decision Tree:
a. Build a decision tree model:

i. Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio

ii. Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set

iii. Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy

iv. Visualize the decision tree using the Graphviz package

Random Forest:
a. Build a Random Forest model: i. Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio

ii. Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set

iii. Build the confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy

iv. Visualize the model using the Graphviz package

Select the best model
a. Print the confusion matrix of all classifiers

b. Print the classification report of all classifiers

c. Calculate Recall Precision and F1 score of all the models

d. Visualize confusion matrix using heatmaps

e. Select the best model based on the best accuracies
